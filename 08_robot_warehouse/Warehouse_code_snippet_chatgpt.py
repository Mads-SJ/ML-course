'''let's break down the steps involved in creating an algorithm that allows a robot to find and deliver a specific box to the package facility. We'll assume the robot knows the location of all boxes and can identify the shortest path to move them.

    Identify the box location: Search the warehouse for the target box (Y) and identify its position.
    Move other boxes if necessary: If there are boxes on top of the target box, move them to another location.
    Retrieve the target box: Once the target box is on top, "dig" for it and then deliver it to the package facility at (0,0).
    Calculate the time taken for the task: Account for the time units taken for each step and action.

Step 1: Identify Box Location

First, we need a function to find the target box's location in the warehouse.'''

                    return (x, y, z)
    return None

'''Step 2 & 3: Algorithm to Pick Up and Deliver the Box

This part involves moving boxes on top, if any, retrieving the target box, and then delivering it.'''

        if warehouse[x][y][z_above] is not None:
            # Find a new position for the box above
            new_pos = find_new_position(warehouse)
            warehouse[new_pos[0]][new_pos[1]][new_pos[2]] = warehouse[x][y][z_above]
            warehouse[x][y][z_above] = None
            # Update steps (considering moving up, placing the box, and coming back)
            steps += (z_above - z) * 2 + 1

    # Retrieve the target box
    warehouse[x][y][z] = None
    steps += (len(warehouse[0][0]) - z) * 2  # Digging down and moving back up
    steps += abs(x) + abs(y)  # Moving to (0,0)

    return steps

def find_new_position(warehouse):
    # Find the first available spot from the top to place a box

                    return (x, y, z)
    return None


'''Note:

    find_box_location: Finds the 3D position of the box in the warehouse.
    move_and_retrieve_box: Moves boxes on top of the target box if necessary, retrieves the target box, and then calculates the steps taken to complete the task.
    find_new_position: Finds the first available position to move a box. This is a simplified approach; in a real scenario, you might want to optimize this to minimize the distance and time. '''

'''Running the Algorithm:

To run this algorithm, you will first need to initialize the warehouse and distribute the boxes as previously described. Then, you can pick a random box to retrieve and calculate the steps required to deliver it to the package facility:'''

import random

# Assuming warehouse is already initialized and boxes are distributed
box_id = random.randint(1, 10000)  # Choose a random box to pick up
steps = move_and_retrieve_box(warehouse, box_id)
print(f"Total steps to retrieve and deliver box {box_id}: {steps}")

'''This code provides a basic simulation for the robot's task of retrieving and delivering a box. Depending on your requirements, you might want to refine it further, such as optimizing the path the robot takes or handling cases where the warehouse is fully occupied more efficiently.'''
